# C Code DECT NR+ Implementation over nRF9161

This repository contains work-in-progress source code and resources for a communication system prototype implementing the **DECT-2020** standard on the **Nordic nRF91X1** System-in-Package (SiP).

The project models the standard using a **finite state machine (FSM)** and integrates the modem via the official **nRF Modem API** to ensure real-time, low-latency operation.

The code was developed by the Universidad Politécnica de Cartagena (UPCT) in cooperation with the Ostfalia University of Applied Sciences as part of the Franco-German joint research project "Media and Event production via Resilient Communication on IoT Infrastructure" (MERCI, grant number 01MJ22016D).

Please place any questions, suggestions and enhancements in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/Opener-Initiative/DECT-NR--Open-Stack/issues) or the [pull requests](https://github.com/Opener-Initiative/DECT-NR--Open-Stack/pulls).

## 🧩 Context Overview

- **Objective:** Develop a DECT NR+ C code implementation modeling ETSI TS 103 636 Parts 1–5.
- **Hardware:** Nordic nRF91X1 (processor + modem).
- **Software Architecture:**
   - FSM controlling system states and protocol flow.
   - I/O Module to inject and extract data from the network.
   - Data buffers for applications to interact with DECT NR+ network.
   - Package Core, composed of packet processor and packet generator.
   - Package queues, TX queue and RX queue.
   - Modem handler to coordinate
   - Packet header definitions and functions for assembling and disassembling.
   - Functions to pack and unpack DECT messages with multiple headers.
- **Focus:** Create a solid base for a telecommunication technology capable of transmitting information in defined scenarios, implementing characteristics from ETSI TS 103 636.
- **Current demos:** IoT Transmission Data

## 🛠️ Usage
Application mode, sensor or gateway, is selected in prj.conf with CONFIG_SENSOR= y / n(N meaning gateway mode)
For a simple approach to the preconfigured Demo, precompiled files for nrf9151-DevKit are available in the demoHex folder. Program *GATEWAY.hex* in the FT device and *SENSOR.hex* in the PT device that will have attached the recommended sensor.

## ⚙️ Building and Running

1. **Requirements**
    - Nordic SDK and toolchain (minimum v2.5.0)
    - DECT modem firmware (minimum v0.5.0-110 prealpha)
    - ~~(Optional) OLED Display SSD1306 0.91 inches~~
    - (Optional) Environmental sensor HTU21D

2. **Build**
    Compile with VS Code + nRF Connect extension, or use west/cmake.

3. **Run**
    - Use the physical hardware to view the real-time demonstrator ~~with the display~~, or run a console using nRF Connect or any serial terminal.
    - Observe FSM transitions and modem events in real time using serial terminal, and monitor data transmission over a DECT NR+ network.

## Optional Hardware Setup

### Release v0.1.0

Although the demo sends dummy data by default, it is recommended to connect a real data source to test the demonstrator’s functionalities. To connect both display and sensor, use the diagram below or configure as needed:

    |     |     |     |              |     |     |     |

+-----------------------+        +-----------------------+

+-----------------------+        +-----------------------+
```

With this setup, you can view association updates on the display and use real data collected by the HTU21D sensor.

## Release v0.2.0

Removed support for OLED Display, data received shall be displayed using a serial terminal.
